# Learning about version control

# Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I like: I think that version control is a very tedious, but an important feature of data science because it allows for better communication and collaboration with group collaborators on projects. Moreover, they make it possible for us to examine our project history and retrieve past versions. 

What I find challenging: I think that version control can be slightly challenging and confusing at the beginning when you are starting to learn how to do version control using Git Bash from your local repository. For example, I felt slightly overwhelmed when learning about all of the commands that we had to know in order to properly move documents from our local repository to the remote repository or vice versa.
